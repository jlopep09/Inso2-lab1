## Inso2-lab1
The goal of this practice is to implement a CI/CD pipeline for an application developed in Go using GitHub Actions and Render.

The link to the app in production is: https://inso2-lab1.onrender.com/

When using the free version of Render, the service shuts down if there is a period of inactivity. If the previous link doesn't work, this is the reason.
